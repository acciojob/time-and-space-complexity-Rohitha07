    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It determines how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input data grows. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they can handle larger inputs without significant performance degradation.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, deals with the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It's often measured in terms of the additional space used by the algorithm relative to the size of the input. One common notation used to express space complexity is <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' represents the size of the input data. It signifies that the space required by the algorithm increases linearly with the input size.
